# Gotham JS Framework

Gotham is a web application framework for front-end development. I'm crafting a lot of web applications with Laravel or Rails and I never found a simple front-end framework to manage my Javascript. I wanted to code my front-end with an expressive syntax, install a package and use it without pain, a require/include function like all others languages, execute something when i need it, and a simple logic.

Gotham was born.

# Official Documentation

Documentation for the framework can be found on the [Gotham website](http://gothamjs.io/documentation).
